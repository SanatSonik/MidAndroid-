Rex Paul Schnelle Say that again


Say that again
Say it real slow
Say it like you mean it
Say it's too soul(?)
I just don't wanna misunderstand
Say that again

You realize the way my eyes adore you
You understand you make this man survive
You say that there's no way
You could ever walk away
You know that those three words keep me alive

Say that again
Say it real slow
Say it like you mean it
Say it's to soul(?)
I just don't wanna misunderstand
Say that again

A magic here is when you say you love me
It turns the luck on my cold heart (...)
The luck of shining through
Shining bright and shining true
You give me love just like you've done before

Say that again
Say it real slow
Say it like you mean it
Say it's to soul(?)
I just don't wanna misunderstand
Say that again
I just don't wanna misunderstand
Say that again
